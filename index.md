I’m a hands-on, pragmatic engineering leader, with 30 years of software development experience including leading development teams, line-managing squads, and solving many varied business problems using my technical skills. Excellent at stakeholder management, building relationships and communicating effectively as well as explaining complex technical issues to non-technical people, I’m a massive fan of using analogies to aid understanding.

I’ve coded in Java since it was launched in 1996, but have used a wide range of different languages for fullstack development. I’ve practiced waterfall, XP & agile methodologies, as well as being an advocate of unit testing, test driven development & pair programming. I spent a decade building telecoms carrier-grade resilient server-side mobile solutions, and over a decade building secure, fast, scalable web applications for the financial industry. I led & managed a 50-strong development team at Very migrating their massive e-commerce monolith to microservices, was CTO for a PropTech scaleup, then CTO for a LegalTech startup and now I'm working with AI & ML at Fuzzy Labs.

I'm passionate about hiring, onboarding & growing tech teams, supporting my engineers development as well as providing technical leadership, mentoring & coaching on software development best practices. I love serverless & cloud computing (both AWS & GCP) and was a member of OWASP to help promote secure coding practices. Extremely comfortable working remotely having spent half of my career working from home! I’m active in the North West meetup scene, and I’ve been fortunate enough to have been a guest on a number of panels and several live webinars over the last few years.
