full stack / security / java / spring / web / agile / mobile / leadership

I'm a full stack senior software engineer with 24 years of software development experience. I've lead development teams, line-managed people, and solved business problems using my technical skills. I've followed waterfall, agile and everything-in-between methodologies, as well as being an advocate of unit testing and test driven development.  I've been coding in Java since it was born back in 1996, but I'm experienced in other languages too. I've spent a chunk of my career building server-side mobile solutions but in recent years transitioned into building secure, fast, scalable web applications for the financial industry.
