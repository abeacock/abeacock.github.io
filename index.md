startup/scaleup CTO | Head of Engineering | Technical Leadership


As a senior engineering leader, I’ve nearly 30 years of software development experience including leading development teams, line-managing squads, and solving many varied business problems using my technical skills. Excellent at building relationships and communicating effectively as well as explaining complex technical issues to non-technical people, I’m a massive fan of using analogies to aid understanding.

I’ve followed waterfall, agile and everything-in-between methodologies, as well as being an advocate of unit testing, test driven development & pair programming. I’ve spent a chunk of my career building telecoms carrier-grade resilient server-side mobile solutions, and over a decade building secure, fast, scalable web applications for the financial industry. I led & managed a 40-strong development team at Very migrating a massive e-commerce monolith to microservices, was Head of Engineering for a PropTech scaleup, and I’m currently CTO for a LegalTech startup.

I'm passionate about hiring, onboarding & growing tech teams, supporting my engineers development as well as providing technical leadership, mentoring & coaching on software development best practices. I love serverless & cloud computing and was a member of OWASP to help promote secure coding practices. Extremely comfortable working remotely having spent half of my career working from home!

I’ve been fortunate enough to have been a guest on several live webinars over the last few years.  I love being able to share my passion for hiring and growing teams, engineering leadership and management, remote working, and personal brand.
