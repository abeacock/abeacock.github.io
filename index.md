I'm a full stack software engineer with 25 years of software development experience. I've lead development teams, line-managed people, and solved business problems using my technical skills. Excellent at explaining complex technical issues to non-technical people, I'm a massive fan of using analogies to aid understanding.  I've followed waterfall, agile and everything-in-between methodologies, as well as being an advocate of unit testing, test driven development& pair programming.  I've been coding in Java since it was born back in 1996, but I'm experienced in other languages too.

I've spent a chunk of my career building telecoms carrier-grade resilient server-side mobile solutions, and over a decade building secure, fast, scalable web applications for the financial industry.  I've now moved into retail to lead & manage a 40-strong development team migrating from a large-scale Java e-commerce monolith to polyglot AWS microservices.

I'm passionate about serverless computing, love golang, and have become a member of OWASP to help promote secure coding practices. Extremely comfortable working remotely having spent nearly half of my career working from home!
