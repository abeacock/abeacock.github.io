subtitle: Startup/Scaleup CTO | Head of Engineering | Technical Leadership
---
As a senior engineering leader, I’ve nearly 30 years of software development experience including leading development teams, line-managing squads, and solving many varied business problems using my technical skills. Excellent at building relationships and communicating effectively as well as explaining complex technical issues to non-technical people, I’m a massive fan of using analogies to aid understanding.

I’ve followed waterfall, agile and everything-in-between methodologies, as well as being an advocate of unit testing, test driven development & pair programming. I’ve spent a chunk of my career building telecoms carrier-grade resilient server-side mobile solutions, and over a decade building secure, fast, scalable web applications for the financial industry. I led & managed a 40-strong development team at Very migrating a massive e-commerce monolith to microservices, was Head of Engineering for a PropTech scaleup, and I’m currently CTO for a LegalTech startup.

I'm passionate about hiring, onboarding & growing tech teams, supporting my engineers development as well as providing technical leadership, mentoring & coaching on software development best practices. I love serverless & cloud computing and was a member of OWASP to help promote secure coding practices. Extremely comfortable working remotely having spent half of my career working from home!

I’ve been fortunate enough to have been a guest on several live webinars over the last few years.  I love being able to share my passion for hiring and growing teams, engineering leadership and management, remote working, and personal brand. For details and links to the recordings please see the ‘Featured’ section on my LinkedIn profile.

## February 2022 to present – Aturna LLC (remote)
### CTO

Responsible for all aspects of technology, engineering & product at Aturna. We’ve built a client-facing US legal services platform currently offering affordable wills, powers of attorney and health care proxies, backed by lawyers.

The engineering team are based in the UK, but the rest of the company are in the US, most in upstate New York, so I’m very familiar with communicating and collaborating remotely with teams spread across time zones.

The platform runs on GCP with a React/Typescript frontend, Scala/Akka backend and a Postgres database. We use Cloud Run & Pub/Sub services (IaC via Terraform), Firebase for frontend hosting & auth and Stripe for card payments.

Following agile product development methodologies (utilising JIRA’s Kanban board) we perform releases at least weekly, with a very high confidence level due to PR code reviews, extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests - we’ve had just a couple of minor post-release issues in the last two years.

* Took sole responsibility of the entire GitHub-based codebase & platform in less than 6 weeks of starting due to the outsourced team being rolled off, hired two excellent engineers within the first month.
* Defined annual technical strategy and quarterly goals, as well as being responsible for the product roadmap
* Monthly company-wide engineering progress presentations, sharing tech achievements in non-technical terms
* Built solid relationships with all members of the organisation enabling fast and effective collaboration
* Coached a lawyer over a period of 6 months to transition into my Head of Product
* Outsourced the IT support & cybersecurity training, negotiating a very favourable contract
* Streamlined the CircleCI-based build/deployment process to speed up deployments and reduce risks
* Setup proactive monitoring & alerting via GCP & Slack to ensure early warning about potential issues
* Introduced Sleuth for release tracking, notifications, and DORA metrics (frequency, lead time, failure rate, MTTR)
* Added Microsoft Clarity for click tracking, hot spots & rage clicks to support a data-driven product roadmap
